Description:
		QueryOverFlow is an online forum which helps people to solve query about government bodies or government schemes. This is similar to StackOverFlow website which helps to solve query related to technology. The forum works as below,

People posts the question in the forum.
Anybody in the forum can answer to the query.
If the user is statisfied with the answer, he can choose statisfied status.
If the user is not statisfied or nobody answereed the query within some configurable time duration, a mail will be sent to respected departments about the query.
Emails will be sent following the hierarchy from regional to commissionarte in case of timeouts.
The above idea is done by running cron job in the server.

		When a person posts a question it will be mined, inorder to find to which category (ie., department) the query is related.

		Seperate profile for administrators are created. This profile has some priviliged access to the website. Admins can view all the queries based on category filter. And admins also has the power to remove a question from the forum or block a user from using the forum. Admins can also mark a question as answered and close that query.
